# airc-micro

## Overview

airc-micro is most tiny AI RC Car project. No camera, no powerful cpu and AI accelerator.

Using simple distance sensor and cheap cpu board such as ESP32, STM32F1xx.

NN is learning on cloud. And deploy to microcontroller by [tensorflow lite for microcontroller](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers).

## Install 

Now, this software target is ESP32-WROOM-D. You can use Arduino IDE.

### Install Library

Install [Arduino_TensorFlowLite_ESP32](https://github.com/tanakamasayuki/Arduino_TensorFlowLite_ESP32).

## Usage

### NN learning on Google Colaboratory.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/masato-ka/airc-micro/blob/tools/airc_micro_tensorflow_keras.ipynb)

You can using simple_airccar_simulation_tensorflow_keras.ipynb. Open notebook with colab. This notebook simulate airc-micro. and running model training. At end of notebook you can download trained model as model of TensorFlow lite for microcontoroller .

Simulation version is here:

### Deploy model file

Replace airc-micro/model/airc_model.cpp with the download file.

### Compile and Write to Board

Open airc-micro.ino with Arduino IDE. Build projects and Write to target board.
